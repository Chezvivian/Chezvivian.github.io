Hi, I am currently a lecturer at School of International Studies in [UIBE](http://sis.uibe.edu.cn/szdwx/xxjs/zyyyxsz/a0565344b91a48ef961297780fe0e181.htm) and previously obtained my PhD degree from Renmin University of China on translation. In my latest research, I used methods including eye-tracking, keystroke-logging and subjective retrospection to investigate the impact of multimodal information on translators' cognitive load. 

I am a frequent user of R and Python, and am obsessed with creating automated workflows in both life and work. 

If you share the same interests, or would like to write or work with me, just reach me at chezvivian@outlook.com.

See you there.
